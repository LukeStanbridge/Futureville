  NpcJob: Draftsperson (Civil or Electrical)
  JobDescription: Working with our Civil and Electrical Engineers, I prepare the
    detailed drawings and plans for our electrical and civil works. Complex electrical
    circuitry or detailed construction plans, I'm across it all. It's easier to make
    changes on a CAD diagram then trying to move something after it's built! I love
    it when a plan comes together.
