  JobDescription: Before a renewable energy project is constructed, I study the past
    human activity of the site. Working with the Cultural Heritage Specialists, we
    recovery and analyse material culture. I explore the artifacts, architecture,
    biofacts and cultural landscapes of another time. It's fascinating and important
    work!
