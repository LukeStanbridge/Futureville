  NpcJob: Civil Engineering Technician
  JobDescription: My job is to support the Civil Engineers in building our renewable
    energy sites. I conduct tests of construction materials, prepare sketches and
    tabulations, and assist in estimating costs. I love getting stuck into a complex
    calculation of the volume of concrete required for an odd shaped structural foundation,
    I'm just like that I guess.
